# Expense tracking application
This project serves as a learning ground for me. I am trying to get myself familiar with the following technologies:

1. Gradle: especially the multi-project feature
2. Spring Data
3. Spring REST Data
4. Spring Vault to use with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

Another goal is to learn React as the same time. However, this is  stretch goal. 

## Progress
So far, I have got the following working

#### Setup Gradle for my project
Gradle is my company official build tool. It makes sense that I should at least be familiar with it.

  :ballot_box_with_check: Gradle multi-project approach

  :ballot_box_with_check: Setup inter-project dependencies

  :ballot_box_with_check: Setup common build scripts in parent project.

#### Setup data access layer using Spring Data JPA
This is a very well known Spring project. It is necessary for me to know about it. I don't have to know it inside out. However, I have to know enough to be able to use it effectively.   
 
  :ballot_box_with_check: Setup entity and repositories classes
  
  :black_square_button: Verified that the data can be saved/retrieved from PostgreSQL database
