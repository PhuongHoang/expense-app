This project serves as a learning ground for me. I am trying to get myself familiar with the following technologies:

1. Gradle: especially the multi-project feature
2. Spring Data
3. Spring REST Data
4. Spring Vault to use with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

Another goal is to learn React as the same time. However, this is  stretch goal.
